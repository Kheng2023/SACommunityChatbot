# SACommunityChatbot  

A sample Python backend code for my contribution to the SACommunity Chatbot project.  

## Project Background  

This chatbot originated from a recommendation by a dear friend with extensive knowledge of the latest trends in AI. He introduced us to **LangChain**, which played a key role in the success of this project.  

The chatbot was initially challenging to deploy due to an outdated interface. To overcome this, we **containerized** the Python code using **Docker**.  

## Requirements  

- **Python 3.10 or higher**  
- Install dependencies using:  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- **Docker** (if deploying via containerization)  

âš  **Note:** The **vectorstore** is not included due to data ownership by **Connecting Up**.  

## Learning & Development Process  

To build this chatbot, I explored and learned **LangChain** from various sources. Here's a recommended step-by-step approach for learning **LangChain**:  

1. **Online Courses**  
   - [LangChain for LLM Application Development](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/accomplishments/25ad5adc-31a0-4473-ba18-b94eed39454e?usp=sharing)  
   - [LangChain Chat with Your Data](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/accomplishments/40ca3d5e-0949-4e6e-a27d-875dec8c10ed?usp=sharing)  
   - [Functions, Tools, and Agents with LangChain](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/accomplishments/1676a458-58eb-4826-97b0-7bb4204942eb?usp=sharing)  

2. **YouTube Tutorials**  
   - [RAG from Scratch by LangChain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd7TZ4w1mSw&list=PLfaIDFEXuae2LXbO1_PKyVJiQ23ZztA0x&ab_channel=LangChain)  

3. **Hands-on Coding**  
   - Start coding along with tutorials.  

4. **Customization**  
   - Once you grasp the basics, modify the code to fit your project needs.  

5. **Documentation Reference**  
   - The [LangChain official documentation](https://python.langchain.com/) provides extensive guides and API references.
